SWAGMOWER is a bot for managing a small gaming group in IRC.  It is a less complicated fork of https://github.com/maradine/ps2bot, which
eventually became PSU's Oracle of Death.

It does three things:

<> Maintains an announcements board.
<> Tracks user presence in Teamspeak.
<> Tracks and nags Stars! players.
